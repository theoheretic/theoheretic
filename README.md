Hello there, I'm Theo. My passtimes are annoying computers and studying. I've written my fair share of programs across varying languages but I enjoy
using languages like Nim, Haskell and Rust to name a few.

While you are already here, I should introduce this fun-sized DIY distro. I mentioned already that it's fun-sized and DIY but it also has lightning
boot times, XBPS and rolling-release. Like what you hear? Good, try it, I bet you will enjoy it!

## Contact me!

I reccomend using Email to contact me. But if you need me on IRC, I go under theoheretic on Libera.Chat.
Other platforms may appear soon. Just don't expect anything like Twitter, BlueSky or Mastodon on here.
